    "Our version of OverlandFlow was tested using the analytical solution for wave propagation on a flat surface case as first presented by Adams et al. (2017) and originally developed by Bates et al. (2010) and Hunter et al. (2005).\n",
    "The idea of this test is to check if our version behaves in the same manner thand as the original OverlandFlow does under unsteady flow conditions. Our simulations were conducted in a flat domain of 6000 m long (x direction) \n",
    "and 800 m high (y direction) in which we used three different uniform grid configurations (∆x=∆y) with spacings of ∆x=5, 10, and 50 m. At the beginning of the simulation the domain was filled with a thin film of water of 1 mm. \n",
    "A uniform roughness coefficient was used (n=0.03). Boundary conditions at the top, right, and bottom edges of the domain were set to closed. Flow enters through the left edge (x=0 m) with a constant velocity of u=1 m/s and v=0 \n",
    "m/s and water depth changes in time according to h(x,t)=h(0,t)=(7⁄3 n^2 u^3 t)^(3⁄7). \n",
    "\n",
    "After 3600 s of simulation we obtained identical results to those presented by Adams et al. (2017), indicating that our modifications to OverlandFlow do not affect the core of the flow solver (Figure 6). A detailed validation\n",
    "is out of the scope our test and analysis but for more details on the validation the reader is referred to Adams et al. (2017).\n",
