    "All our previous bed evolution tests had a predominant flow direction and were restricted to pure erosion or deposition. We conducted a final test of our LEM in a more complex and larger watershed to analyze the how flow discharge and bed surface elevation varies at different locations within the domain under different rainfall events. We used the synthetic square watershed from Adams et al. (2017) which has an area of 36 km2 with a resolution of 30 x 30 m per pixel and elevations ranging from 0 m at the basin outlet to 225 m at the highest point (Figure 10 a). Two cases of temporal distribution of rainfall intensity were considered, both having the same total volume of water precipitated (10 mm). We referred to these cases as i) uniform, in which the rainfall intensity was 5 mm/hr lasting for two hours and ii) intermittent, where rainfall can reach up to 25 mm/hr during 350 s and then goes back to zero (Figure 10 b). Changes in flow discharge and bed surface elevation were quantified in three locations: Site 1 which coincides with the watershed outlet, Site 2 located upstream the outlet and upstream the confluence of the most downstream tributaries, and Site 3 located approximately at the center of the watershed (Figure 10 a). \n",
    "\n",
    "We ran each model for 24 hours, set Manning’s n constant in the whole watershed with a value of 0.035, set the option for  steep_slopes to True in OverlandFlow, used the bed load transport equation of Meyer-Peter & Müller (1948) with a D_50 of 32 mm, and allowed the critical shear stress to vary spatially using the equation of  Mueller et al. (2005) (variableCriticalShearStress = True). All other variables during the instantiation of the components had default values. Each rainfall intensity case was simulated with and without activating riverBedDynamics (4 cases in total) to analyze the effect that the selected temporal distribution of rainfall intensity has on flow hydraulics (e.g., flow discharge) and in turn on morphological changes. When running only OverlandFlow (i.e., riverBedDynamics deactivated) the resulting hydrograph for both the uniform and intermittent cases have a relatively smooth shape at the three sites (Figure 10 b). In the intermittent case, the peak discharge arrives first at every site and has a larger magnitude (50.9 m3/s arriving after 2.1 hours compared to 42.8 m3/s at 2.6 hours for the uniform case). If the bed surface elevation evolves as a function of the local flow conditions (i.e., riverBedDynamics is activated) the resulting hydrograph had a lower peak discharge. At the outlet and at Site 2 the reductions are nearly 15% and 33% for the uniform and intermittent case, respectively (Figure 10 b). At Site 3 the changes in hydrograph shape are relatively small with discharge peak decreasing from 14.7 to 14.2 m3/s in the uniform case and from 20.3 to 18.9 m3/s in the intermittent scenario. Additionally, the shape of the hydrograph at sites 1 and 2 is no longer smooth everywhere and contains a small spike at the location of the highest discharge. In general, the rising and falling hydrograph limbs in both rainfall scenarios and in all sites are similar and the curves practically overlap each other. The largest differences in magnitude are concentrated around the peak discharge. To better understand how bed evolution affects flow dynamics we integrated the hydrographs in time and obtained the cumulative flow volume (subpanel cumulative flow volume, Figure 10 b). When considering the no bed evolution case, approximately after one day of simulation the flow exiting the watershed (sampled at the outlet) is equal to the volume of water that entered as precipitation (36·104 m3). This proves that mass is well preserved in OverlandFlow and that the square watershed has no sinkholes. However, a difference of 19.4·103 and 48.6·103 m3 between the predicted cumulative flow volume and total rainfall is observed in the uniform and intermittent cases, respectively, when we let the bed evolve. This is not a mass conservation problem but rather a consequence of erosion and deposition patterns within the basin. In the selected sites riverBedDynamics predicts only deposition of sediment, except for Site 3 in the uniform rainfall intensity where the change is practically null. For these places, the intermittent scenario generates consistently larger depositions compared to the uniform case. Most of the bed elevation changes occurred during the first 3 hours of simulation, where the larger discharges and therefore larger shear stresses occurred. In other locations within the watershed we observed scour and deposition of sediments (Figure 11 a and b).\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences between the predicted cumulative flow volume and total rainfall after 24 hours of simulations can be explained by the morphological changes within the watershed. Here, we analyzed in more detail the intermittent case, but the same analysis is valid for the uniform scenario. When we let the bed evolve different patterns of erosion and deposition were created in the basin (Figure 11 a). In the intermittent case bed surface elevation changes ranged approximately between -2 to 2 m (±1.25 m in the uniform case). This combination of local scour and deposition affected the local flow and created zones that retained large volumes of water (Figure 11 b and c) in quantities practically equal to the volume differences (48.6·103 m3 for the intermittent case). They are not equal because after 24 hours the discharge flowing at the outlet is still 0.052 m3/s and reaches zero at around 36 hours. Most of the nodes where erosion or deposition was predicted are located close to confluences or regions where there are changes in the local channel streamwise direction. The total area that had erosion or deposition larger than 1 cm is 0.2907 km2.\n",
