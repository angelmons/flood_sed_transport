# MultiGrain
This is a working repo which has two purposes.
  1) Taking two proposed components to LandLab (RiverBedDynamics and edits to OverlandFlow) and applying them to Last Chance Canyon, NM, USA. I am using storm duration 
  and intensity data from NOAA to inform our model experiments and see how often sediment is transported and deposited.
  2) I am building JupyterHub tutorials for these components by trying to replicate some of Angel Monsalve's resuls. These live in the jupyter_example folder.
Enjoy!
